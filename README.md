# Azure Policy Repository

Welcome to the Azure Policy repository, where you can efficiently manage Azure Policies through code. This repository is organized into two key folders:

## Policies

Explore the 'policies' folder to discover custom policy definitions. Each subfolder represents a distinct custom policy, with the 'policy.json' file containing the policy definition.

## Initiatives

Navigate to the 'initiatives' folder to find custom initiative definitions. Each subfolder represents an individual initiative, and the 'policy.json' file contains the initiative definition. Additionally, you'll find a 'policyset.json' file that includes the initiative assignment definition.

Feel free to explore, contribute, and collaborate on enhancing Azure Policy management in a code-driven manner!
